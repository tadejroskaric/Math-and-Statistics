# Math and Statistics
Here are some simple projects on basic mathematical and statistical concepts in Python.

I am including a brief description of the files:

dice_chance.py. It is a well known concept that the probability of a dice throw resulting in a specific number between 1 and 6 is approximately 16,6667%.
This obviously implies that we repeat the dice throw quite a number of times and for this reason I created a loop that resembles 100.000 dice throws and
extracts the values for each number from 1 to 6. The results confirm the initial hypothesis.
