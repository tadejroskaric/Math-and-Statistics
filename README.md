# Math and Statistics
Here are some simple projects on basic mathematical and statistical concepts in Python.

I am including a brief description of the files:

dice_chance.py. It is a well known concept that the probability of a dice throw resulting in a specific number between 1 and 6 is approximately 16,6667%.
This obviously implies that we repeat the dice throw quite a number of times and for this reason I created a loop that resembles 100.000 dice throws and
extracts the values for each number from 1 to 6. The results confirm the initial hypothesis.

rock_paper_scissors.py. When playing rock, paper, scissors, there should be a 1 in 3 chance of you winning if you do it over and over many times. I checked
this concept in Python and came to the conclusion that this statement is true. With 10000 iterations player1 gets approximately 3300 wins.

conf_int.py. This file calculates the confidence interval for the mean of a small sample.

lin_regres.py. Analog way of doing linear regression.

mean_var_std_dev_classic.py. The classic way to calculate the mean, variance and standard deviation.
